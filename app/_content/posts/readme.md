Hey, I'm Charlie Meyer.

## Currently

I'm a third year @ UVA studying Computer Science and Entrepreneurship. I'm a 2025 [Neo Scholar](https://neo.com/scholars), Model UN-er, dedicated weightlifter, and decent snowboarder. Previously, I've worked at [Principal Financial](https://www.principal.com/), [Scenthound](https://www.scenthound.com/), and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). I also hack on side projects like [Hufflo](https://hufflo.com/) and [simpletext](https://simpletext.ai/).

I work on inference research with [Zhepei Wei](https://weizhepei.com/) and independently explore AI for math research. How can we get LLMs to reason in formal math (Lean)?

## Future

The intersection of what I'm good at, what I care about, and what's important in the world is AGI and AI safety. So I'm working on that, and
its subproblems. That currently being inference research, automated theorem proving, and some safety work.

I'm also deeply interested in the infrastructure behind AI research. It's incredibly hard to do training at scale. Why is it so hard to run experiments at scale, multi-node, multi-gpu? Training and serving models should be as easy as developing and deploying web apps.

Aside from running the SF marathon again, I need to run the NYC Marathon. I'd want to get to the [Copenhagen Open](https://www.cphopen.com/) or [Dime](https://dimemtl.com/blogs/videos).

## Talk to me

I'm open to work. If my interests align with what you're doing or are just someone who's incredibly passionate about something, I'd love to chat.
