## currently

I'm a fourth year @ UVA studying computer science and entrepreneurship. I'm a 2025 [Neo Scholar](https://neo.com/scholars), Model UN-er, dedicated weightlifter, and (decent) snowboarder. Previously, I've worked at [Principal Financial](https://www.principal.com/), [Scenthound](https://www.scenthound.com/), and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

I work on inference speedup research (speculative decoding) with [Zhepei Wei](https://weizhepei.com/) and independently explore AI for math research. How can we get LLMs to reason in formal math (Lean)?

## future

The intersection of what I'm good at, what I care about, and what's important in the world is AGI and AI safety. So I'm working on that, and
its subproblems. That currently being inference research, automated theorem proving, and some interpretability work.

I'm also deeply interested in the infrastructure behind AI research. Why is it so hard to run experiments at scale, multi-node, multi-gpu? Training and serving models should be as easy as developing and deploying web apps.

## talk to me

I'm open to work at somewhere dope. If my interests align with what you're doing or are just someone who's incredibly passionate about something, I'd love to chat.
